Description: Concrete strength at 28 day is the representative property to show its performance as a structural material. Mix proportion of raw materials determines the strength development. The data provide various mix proportions to produce 1 cubic meter concrete and their strength at a specific age. 

1. Cement (kg in a m^3 mixture)
2. Ground-Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (kg in a m^3 mixture)
3. Fly Ash (kg in a m^3 mixture)
4. Water (kg in a m^3 mixture)
5. Superplasticizer (kg in a m^3 mixture)
6. Coarse Aggregate (kg in a m^3 mixture)
7. Fine Aggregate (kg in a m^3 mixture)
8. Age (day)
9. Concrete compressive strength (MPa)
